<p>ISLEX is an on-again, off-again project whose goal is to provide
feature-rich dictionaries for speech technology.  The current English
dictionary has 300,000 entries, culled from open-source dictionaries
including CMUdict and Moby.</p>

<p><b>LICENSE:</b> ISLEdict is distributed under
the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY
4.0</a> license.  We try to make sure that all of our sources have
license terms that are at least as permissive.</p>

<p><b>FEATURES:</b> The dictionary includes the following information.
Pronunciation is available for every word.  Syllabification and
lexical stress are available for many words. Part of speech and named
entity tags (when appropriate) exist for most words. Morphology exists
for only a few words.
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Part of speech</b> is derived from
      the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/areas/nlp/parsing/taggers/brill/0.html">Brill
      part of speech tagger</a>, from
      the <a href="http://www-01.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software.asp?id=22">SIL
      KTagger</a> program, and from named entity files.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Named entity</b> tags are labeled with "nnp" or "nnps", followed
      by the named entity type. The following tags currently exist.
      <ul>
	<li><tt>(nnp (surname|boyname|girlname) \d\.\d\d\d)</tt>
	  specifies that the entry was logged as a surname, male given
	  name, or female given name in
	  the <a href="https://www.census.gov/dmd/www/90census.html">1990
	    U.S. Census</a>, or was listed as one of these name types in a
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_United_States_Census">relevant
	    wikipedia entry</a>, or (in the case of manual verification)
	  elsewhere on the web.  The number at the end of the entry
	  specifies the percent frequency of the surname, male name, or
	  female name in 1990 U.S. Census data, rounded to the nearest
	  thousandth of one percent.</li>
	<li><tt>(nnp city)</tt> tags
	  include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_cities_with_100,000_or_more_inhabitants">cities
	    with more than 100,000 inhabitants</a>, U.S. state capitols,
	  and other cities.</li>
	<li><tt>(nnp country)</tt>
	  includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations">member
	    states of the United Nations</a>, and an assortment of other
	  country-like entities (dependent protectorates, historical
	  nations, etc.).</li>
	<li><tt>(nnp continent)</tt> and <tt>(nnp state)</tt> are used
	  to mark continents and U.S. states.</li>
	<li><tt>(nnp place)</tt> is used for
	  other places including rivers, mountains, planets and moons, and
	  mythical places.</li>
	<li><tt>(nnp product)</tt> is used generically for
	  registered trademarks, generic names of medicines, types of
	  music, and names of philosophies (e.g., <tt>dixieland (nnp
	    product)</tt>).</li>
	<li><tt>(nnp company)</tt> is a for-profit corporation; <tt>(nnp
	    organization)</tt> is any non-country, non-company organization.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Morphology:</b> two types of morphological information are
      provided by
      the <a href="http://www-01.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software.asp?id=22">SIL
	KTagger</a> program for the words it knows (with some extra
      labels provided by hand): 1. <tt>( root:)</tt> specifies the root word
      2. <tt>(morphology:...+...)</tt> specifies orthographic morpheme
      decomposition for words with known non-trivial decomposition.
