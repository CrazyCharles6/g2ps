﻿There are a total of 53 letters in the Javanese script, but the number of represented phonemes vary accordingly to the language being written. For example, transcription of Sanskrit uses 33 consonants and 14 vowels, while the modern orthography (based on the Javanese language) uses 20 consonants and 5 vowels. The other letters have lost their original distinct pronunciations and are used instead for honorific purposes.[6]
Consonant letters are as follows:
Wyanjana (Consonants)IPAhanatʃarakadatasawalapaɖadʒajaɲamagabaʈaŋaTranscriptionhanacarakadatasawalapadhajayanyamagabathangaNglegénaꦲꦤꦕꦫꦏꦢꦠꦱꦮꦭꦥꦣꦗꦪꦚꦩꦒꦧꦛꦔMurdaꦟꦖ1ꦑꦝꦡꦯꦦꦘ2ꦓꦨMahapranaꦰꦞꦙꦜModern Javanese uses 20 consonants, and each consonant can be represented with up to 3 letter cases: a lower case called nglegéna, an upper case called murda or gedé, and the mahaprana case.[1]
Murda are similar to capital letters, but they are not used at the beginning of a sentence. They are used as honorifics in the first syllable of a proper name, usually that of a respected person or a place. Not all nglegéna letters have a murda form, and if a murda letter is not available for a name's first syllable, the second letter is capitalized. If the second letter does not have a murda either, the third letter is capitalized, and so on. Highly respected names may be all capitalized if the corresponding murda are available.
Mahaprana translates to "aspirated". They were originally aspirated consonants used in Sanskrit and Kawi transliterations. However, their occurrence is rare. Their proper usage in modern orthography is otherwise unknown, as there are no aspirated consonants in modern Javanese, and they are often omitted from books discussing the script.[3]
To produce pure vowels, ꦲ ha is used to represent zero consonant.[16] Otherwise, there are also letters for pure vowels called swara as follows:
Swara (Vowels)AksaraꦄꦆꦈꦌꦎIPAaiueoTranscriptionaiueoSwara are used to differentiate proper names in a similar matter to murda. For example, the verb ayu (graceful) is written with the syllable ha (ꦲꦪꦸ) while the personal name Ayu is written with swara instead (ꦄꦪꦸ). Swara are also used for words of foreign origin. The element Argon for example, is written with swara.[12][17]
Pasangan[edit]
Pasangan is a counterpart of aksara, usually in subscript form, that eliminates the inherent vowel of the attaching syllable. It is used for consonant clusters or closed syllables that occur in the middle of a sentence. For example, nda is made by attaching pasangan da to the syllable na.[3]

However, the letter can be sub-scripted in similar manner to disambiguate proper names.[17]
Additional Aksara[edit]
Due to the loss of their original pronunciation or to accommodate foreign loan words, there are several aksara that are re-categorized and added in the modern repertoire. Each of these additional aksara has a pasangan, but they are devoid of murda or mahaprana case. They are as follows:[3][17]

As it already carries a fixed vowel value, it may not be attached with vowel diacritics.ꦊ◌꧀ꦊləleNga leletꦋ◌꧀ꦋlɤleuNga lelet raswadiMiscellaneousꦬ◌꧀ꦬraraRa agungHistorically used by some writers to address royal figures.ꦐ◌꧀ꦐqaqaKa sasakTraditional transliteration of /qa/ adopted from the Sasak language.Rekanꦲ꦳◌꧀ꦲ꦳ħahaRekan[18]Most sounds not native to the Javanese language are indicated by adding U+A9B3 ◌꦳ JAVANESE SIGN CECAK TELU over similar sounding syllable. The resulting letters are called rekan or rekaan, which is commonly used for Arabic and Dutch loanwords. Additional rekan further extend Arabic and even add Chinese sounds, however their occurrence is rare.ꦏ꦳◌꧀ꦏ꦳xakhaꦢ꦳◌꧀ꦢ꦳ðadzaꦗ꦳◌꧀ꦗ꦳zazaꦱ꦳◌꧀ꦱ꦳ʃasyaꦒ꦳◌꧀ꦒ꦳ɣaghaꦥ꦳◌꧀ꦥ꦳fafaꦔ꦳◌꧀ꦔ꦳ʔa'aN/A ?theN/A ?seN/A ?nieN/A ?hweN/A ?yoN/A ?syoSandhangan[edit]
Diacritics or dependent signs are called sandhangan (ꦱꦟ꧀ꦝꦔꦤ꧀). They are as follow:[17]

Main article: Javanese numerals
The Javanese numeral system has its own script, which only contains 0–9 numerals.[8]
Angka (Numeral)Numeral1234567890Angka꧑꧒꧓꧔꧕꧖꧗꧘꧙꧐NamesijilorotelupapatlimanempituwolusanganolWhen writing numbers greater than 9, the above numbers are simply combined as one would do using the Arabic numerals. For example, 21 is written by combining the numeral 2 and 1 as so; ꧒꧑. Similarly, the number 90 would be the ꧙꧐.[8]
Most of the numbers are similar to the syllable characters. To avoid confusion, numbers that show up in Javanese texts are indicated by "numeral indicators" called pada pangkat, written both before and after the number, following the pattern: text - indicator - numbers - indicator - text. For example; Tuesday, 19 March 2013 would be written as ꦱꦼꦭꦱ꧇꧑꧙꧇ꦩꦉꦠ꧀꧇꧒꧐꧑꧓꧇ (selasa 19 maret 2013).[8]
Punctuation[edit]
Primary Pada[8]PadaNameDescription꧊Pada adegParentheses or quotation marks꧋Pada adeg-adegIntroduce a paragraph or section꧌ and ꧍Pada piselehFunctions similarly to pada adeg꧈Pada lingsaFunctions similarly to a comma but not needed after a consonant-ending word that is represented by a pangkon. It acts as a period if preceded by pangkon.꧉Pada lungsiPeriod.꧇Pada pangkatNumeral indicator or colonꧏPada rangkepIteration mark. It functions similarly to 2 or 2 in the Indonesian Republican Spelling System. The character derives from the Arabic digit two but does not have a numeric use. It was proposed as a separate character because of the bidirectional properties of the Arabic digit.[3][17]Special pada[8]PadaNameDescription꧁ and ꧂RerenganFlanks title꧅Pada luhurIntroduces a letter to a person of older age or higher rank꧄Pada madyaIntroduces a letter to a person of equal age or rank꧃Pada andhapIntroduces a letter to a person of younger age or lower rank꧋꧐꧋Pada guruIntroduces a letter without age or rank distinction꧉꧐꧉Pada pancakEnds a letter꧅ꦧ꧀ꦖ꧅

There are two special marks to indicate error in writing, ꧞ pada tirta tumétés and ꧟ pada isèn-isèn. Though only used in handwriting, the two are included in the Unicode range for the purpose of rendering Javanese texts. Tirta tumétés is used in Yogyakarta, while isèn-isèn is used in Surakarta. For example, a scribe wants to write pada luhur, but wrote pada wu ..., a scribe from Yogyakarta would write:
ꦥꦢꦮꦸ꧞꧞꧞ꦭꦸꦲꦸꦂ
Pada wu---luhur
In Surakarta, it would be:
ꦥꦢꦮꦸ꧟꧟꧟ꦭꦸꦲꦸꦂ[17]
