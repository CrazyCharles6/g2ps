# g2ps
Data and code for grapheme-to-phoneme transducers in many languages.

This repo contains plaintext and CSV source files
for the data in http://isle.illinois.edu/sst/data/g2ps/, and 
code (mostly ruby) that creates HTML files from them.

If your code uses these files, use the plaintext versions.
The HTML versions let web clients, which often misdisplay UTF-8 plaintext,
render the text correctly.

Instead of pushing your own commits to this repo, ask Mark to do so,
because he builds these files from many other sources.
