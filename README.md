# g2ps
Data and code for grapheme-to-phoneme transducers in lots of languages

Basically, this directory contains plaintext and CSV source files
for the data in http://isle.illinois.edu/sst/data/g2ps/, and 
code (mostly ruby) that creates the HTML files from these source
plaintext.  If you are using these files in your own code, you probably
want these plaintext files anyway, you probably don't want the HTML
versions -- the web page shows HTML versions only because most web
clients don't correctly display plaintext UTF-8 files.
