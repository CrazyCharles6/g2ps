## README: Dictionary data
#

Right now, this is just a working directory containing files that
might be useful in the creation of dictionaries or G2P for all of
these languages.

Subdirectories currently named by the most(?) common English-language
name of the language.  Subdirectories are capitalized in an attempt to
show respect to speakers of the language.

languages.txt - lists the ISO 639-3 code for each language, in case
you're not sure which language is referenced by a name.
