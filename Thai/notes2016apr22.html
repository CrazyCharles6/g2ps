Notes on Thai alphabet

A syllable is:

first part of vowel symbol, if any, J

onset consonant, K

vowel diacritic, if any, L

tone symbol, if any, M

other diacritic, if any, N

vowel symbol, if any, P

coda consonant, if any, Q


coda and vowel change the tone, so we need a complete
JKLMNP  syllabary.  J=6, I think.  K=44 but in 3 classes.
L=9.  M=4.  N=3.  P=11. Q=44.

So, 6-digit state numbers.

1st digit:
0 = no initial vowel yet.
1..5: corresponding initial vowel has been seen.
  transitions into these generate no IPA.

2nd digit:
0 = no initial consonant yet.
1..3: corresponding onset consonant class has been seen.
  transitions into 1..3 generate the corresponding IPA consonant.

3rd digit:
0 = no vowel diacritic seen yet.
1..8: corresponding vowel diacritic seen.
  transitions into these generate no IPA.

4th digit:
0 = no tone diacritic seen yet.
1..4: corresponding tone seen.
  transitions into these generate no IPA.

5th digit:
0 = no other diacritic seen yet.
1..2: corresponding diacritic seen.
  transitions into these generate no IPA.

6th digit:
0 = no final vowel symbol seen yet.
1..9: corresponding final vowel symbol seen.
  transitions into these generate no IPA.

7th digit:
0 = no final shortener, r, or l seen yet
1 = no final shortener.  transitions into this generate a vowel.
2..4: corresponding final shortener or modifier seen; generate a vowel.

For every state that is a possible combination of the above, there are
45 output edges corresponding to the 44 possible final consonant
symbols, and epsilon.  Each final consonant symbol necessarily
generates the toneme symbol, and the final consonant symbol.

Syllable may begin with a consonant cluster (or consonant, inherent
vowel, consonant!), therefore from every state of the form xy00000,
there are 44 edges leaving that symbol going to other states of the
form xy00000, each corresponding to the append of another consonant to
the initial cluster.  Not sure if I should also assume an inherent
vowel here or not.
